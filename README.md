# FYP Portfolio Supplementary Files

Due to the quantity of code involved in this project, all files are stored in this GitHub repository. There's almost 1GB of data here, so the portfolio would end up being significantly more than 100 pages.


# Folders

There are four folders in this project:

 - CCS Application
 - KiCAD
 - SolidWorks
 - User Interface Application

## CCS Application

This folder holds the code for the PlatformIO-based CCS software. The primary folder in here is "(Main)FYP Project - ESP", however older revisions of the software, and revisions for different platforms, are available also.

## KiCAD

This folder holds all of the PCB designs for the project, including multiple revisions of the heater, and an unused design for a motor controller board.

## SolidWorks

This folder holds all of the 3D models for the project, as well as some renders used in the portfolio.

- Assemblies holds packaged assemblies for the project. RigV2 is the version used in the portfolio.
- Renders holds the renders used in the report.
- All files holds every revision of every file in the project, but these aren't packed to go.

## User Interface Application

This folder holds the front-end application for the project, build with NextJS. There is only one version of this application. You'll need NodeJS installed to run these.
